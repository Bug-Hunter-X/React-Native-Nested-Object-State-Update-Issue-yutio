This React Native code snippet demonstrates a potential issue where the state update might not correctly reflect changes within a nested object.

```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const [myData, setMyData] = useState({ nested: { value: 'initial' } });

  const updateNestedValue = () => {
    setMyData({ ...myData, nested: { ...myData.nested, value: 'updated' } });
  };

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>{myData.nested.value}</Text>
      <Button title="Update Value" onPress={updateNestedValue} />
    </View>
  );
};

export default MyComponent;
```

The issue is that while the state update seems correct, it can cause unexpected behavior if not handled carefully in certain complex scenarios.  The spread syntax (`...`) used here is creating a new nested object, but if there are many levels of nesting or other more complex data structures involved, it might lead to performance degradation or unexpected re-renders.
